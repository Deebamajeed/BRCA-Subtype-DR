# BRCA-Subtype-DrugResponse

This repository contains the code to create models for BRCA subtype classification and drug response prediction.

Subtype Classification:
This folder contains python files to build models for single omics and multiomics data both with late and early integration.
Our proposed models was developed using AutoEncoder (python based). RandomForest and ElasticNet  (with R plug-in for python) were used to compare the performance with proposed model.

Drug Response:
The jupyter notebook contains code for building regression model and classifier.
The code for prepration and analysis of TCGA data is also avaialable.
